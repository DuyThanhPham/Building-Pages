In this project I chose Vite, React, and Tailwind CSS to build the project and below are some of the benefits of choosing the above libraries.

With Vite

1. High Performance:
- Vite provides a rapid development environment using ESBuild, which enables extremely fast development server startup and efficient HMR (Hot Module Replacement) support.

2. Simple Configuration:
- Vite has a very good default configuration, which helps save time configuring projects. However, it can still be easily customized when needed.

3. ES Module Support:
- Vite leverages ES modules to quickly load modules during development, helping to reduce page load times and improve the development experience.

4. Great Integration with Libraries and Frameworks:
- Vite has good support for popular libraries and frameworks such as React, Vue, Svelte, etc.

With Tailwind CSS
1. Utility-First CSS:
- Tailwind CSS provides a rich system of utility-classes, making it easy to build interfaces without having to write a lot of custom CSS.

2. Highly Customizable:
- Tailwind is easily customizable through the configuration file, allowing you to create utility-classes as you like.

3. Performance:
- Tailwind CSS removes unused CSS when building the final product, helping to reduce CSS file size and improve page loading performance.

4. Responsive Design:
- Tailwind CSS supports responsive design very well with corresponding utility classes, helping to create interfaces compatible with many devices easily
